# Goal: Show minecraft avatars for MC -> Discord messages. We want to use the
# IconURL setting, but this setting can only be applied on account level, not
# per gateway (a bit stupid ngl, we should be able to change settings for each
# inout gateway). So, we need to create a separate account definition that
# has all-identical settings, except for IconURL.
